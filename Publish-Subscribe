rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged

The core idea in the messaging model in RabbitMQ is that the producer never sends any messages directly to a queue
Instead, the producer can only send messages to an exchange.
An exchange is a very simple thing. On one side it receives messages from producers and the other side it pushes them to queues.
There are a few exchange types available: direct, topic, headers and fanout. 

The fanout exchange is very simple. As you can probably guess from the name, 
it just broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows
